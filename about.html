          <h3>The One Ring to Rule Them All</h3>
          <p>
            The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy saga written by J.R.R.
            Tolkien, set in the mythical world of Middle-earth. At the heart of
            the story lies the One Ring — a golden band of immense power, forged
            by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. The Ring
            corrupts all who possess it, binding them to Sauron’s will. After
            centuries of being lost, it finds its way into the hands of a humble
            hobbit: Frodo Baggins.
          </p>

          <h3>A Hobbit's Burden</h3>
          <p>
            Frodo is tasked with an impossible mission: to carry the Ring back
            to Mount Doom and destroy it once and for all. If he fails, Sauron
            will rise again and cast all of Middle-earth into eternal darkness.
            Frodo is joined by loyal friends — Samwise Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck,
            and Pippin Took — forming the beginning of a journey that tests
            courage, loyalty, and sacrifice.
          </p>

          <h3>The Fellowship Forms</h3>
          <p>
            To aid Frodo, a fellowship of nine is formed: Frodo and his hobbit
            friends, Gandalf the Grey (a wise and powerful wizard), Aragorn (a
            ranger with a royal bloodline), Legolas (an elven archer), Gimli (a
            stout-hearted dwarf), and Boromir (a warrior of Gondor). Together,
            they face treacherous lands, ancient evils, and internal divisions,
            all while Sauron’s armies grow stronger.
          </p>

          <h3>From Rivendell to Mordor</h3>
          <p>
            The Fellowship journeys through snow-covered mountains, the shadowy
            Mines of Moria, the forests of Lothlórien, and down the River Anduin
            — all while hunted by orcs, Ringwraiths, and creatures corrupted by
            the Ring’s power. But even the strongest bonds are tested. The
            Fellowship breaks, and each member must walk their own path in the
            great war to come.
          </p>

          <h3>The Rise of the Free Peoples</h3>
          <p>
            As Frodo and Sam venture closer to Mount Doom, the others rally the
            kingdoms of Men, Elves, and Dwarves to stand against Sauron. Aragorn
            claims his destiny as the rightful King of Gondor, leading armies
            into battle at Helm's Deep and the Black Gate. Gandalf returns as
            Gandalf the White to guide them all in the final stand between light
            and shadow.
          </p>

          <h3>The Final Sacrifice</h3>
          <p>
            In the end, it is not great strength or magical power that destroys
            the Ring — but persistence, love, and the unexpected mercy Frodo
            shows to Gollum. As Frodo reaches Mount Doom, corrupted by the Ring,
            he is unable to let it go. But Gollum, obsessed with "his precious,"
            seizes it from Frodo and falls into the lava — destroying the Ring
            and Sauron with it.
          </p>

          <h3>A New Age Begins</h3>
          <p>
            With the Ring gone, peace returns to Middle-earth. Aragorn is
            crowned king. The Elves begin their departure to the Undying Lands.
            And Frodo, forever changed by the burden he carried, chooses to join
            them, leaving the Shire and his old life behind. The tale closes
            with Sam returning home, carrying the memory of the greatest
            adventure ever told.
          </p>

          <h3>The Legacy</h3>
          <p>
            The Lord of the Rings is more than a fantasy tale — it's a timeless
            story of friendship, sacrifice, courage, and the power of hope. It
            reminds us that even the smallest person can change the course of
            the future.
